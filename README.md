# HOME AUTOMATION BASED
* My idea is to run the exhaust fan and the lighting in kitchen
* It can done by mannual and by sensor
* Using UART signal i have implemented it.
* By typing commends by opening *__serial monitor__* in atmega.

 ## __Commends__
*  L-Light on.
* l-light off.
* F-fan on (motor will run)
* f-fan off(motor stops)
