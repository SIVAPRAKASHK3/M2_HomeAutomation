# Requirements

##  Feautures
  * Easy in controlling the exhaust  fan and lighting.
  * Automatic controlling using motion retection .

## Research
  * Referred many Arduino IR sensor based projects.
  * Referred many e-sources for coding part.
       
##  Key feautures
  * Monitoring the motion, if any one present control lighting and exhaust fan.

# The 4W's and a H 

## WHAT
  * It is the controlling of lighting and fan by mannual using commends by typing in serial monitor and also automatically.
## WHY
  * The main objective of this project is to control the lighting and exhaust fan.
## WHO
  * In house and hotels who require auto ventilation for proper air flow.
## WHERE
  * This project mainly comes in use at house and hotels.
## HOW
  * This project is implemented using "Embedded C Program" based on AVR programming.

# SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
 ## STRENGTHS:
   * Easily Operating.
   * Platform Independant.
   * Controlling using UART.
 ## WEAKNESS:
   * Carefull while enteing  comments 
 ## THREATS:
   * If any of the switches are failed to operate connected may fail.
   * Be Carefull while enteing  comments .
