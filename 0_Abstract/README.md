# Abstract
#
**This project is based on implementing the home automation.If the motion
is detected the fan and the lighiting will be turned on,it is achieved 
by *__sensor__*.The command based operation is posible and it is implemented 
using *__UART__* , for fan i have used an simple DC motor.The overall set is 
divided into two setup simulation 1(work based on commands) and simulation 2
(work based on sensor input).Tsimulation 1 is works by the commands given by 
user but the commands are pre-defined.**
